This project presents the development of a home automation control system based on brain-computer interfaces (BCI). The main objective is to implement a non-invasive system that enables the integration of brain signals with smart lighting devices, specifically TP-Link Tapo bulbs.

The system uses the Brainbit headband as an electroencephalographic (EEG) signal acquisition device, processing these signals through a software architecture that combines PyTorch for training deep learning models and Rust for the development of the inference engine.

The theoretical framework addresses the development of a classification model based on EEG signals, exploring signal processing and machine learning techniques for accurate interpretation of brain patterns. Additionally, it delves into the technical and regulatory requirements necessary for medical device development, with special emphasis on the IEC 62304 standard for medical device software life cycle processes, and the implementation of real-time operating systems (RTOS) to ensure system reliability and safety.

The proposed solution integrates modern brain signal processing technologies with home automation systems, creating a natural and intuitive interface for controlling the home environment. This project represents a step towards the democratization of brain-computer interfaces in everyday applications.
