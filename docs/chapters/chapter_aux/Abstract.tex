This project presents the development of a home automation control system based on brain-computer interfaces (BCI). The main objective is to implement a non-invasive system that allows mental control of smart lighting devices, specifically Tapo bulbs.

The system uses the Brainbit headband as an electroencephalographic (EEG) signal acquisition device, processing these signals through a software architecture that combines PyTorch for deep learning model training and Rust for inference engine development.

The theoretical framework addresses the development of a classification model based on EEG signals, exploring signal processing and machine learning techniques for accurate interpretation of brain patterns. Additionally, it delves into the technical and regulatory requirements necessary for medical device development, with special focus on IEC 62304 standard for medical device software lifecycle processes, and the implementation of real-time operating systems (RTOS) to ensure system reliability and safety.

The proposed solution integrates modern brain signal processing technologies with home automation systems, creating a natural and intuitive interface for home environment control. This project represents a step towards the democratization of brain-computer interfaces in everyday applications.
